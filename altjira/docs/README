What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Altjira (Ionflux' Image Processing Library) is an image processing 
library written in C++. It is designed to be used with Python and uses 
the well known GDK-PixBuf library for the low-level image handling.

I decided to write this to have native implementations for some image 
processing tasks I use in my Python applications, which were too slow 
when implemented in Python. Therefore, there is no immediate goal for 
Altjira to be "complete" or generic. However, it does provide a nice 
way of adding native image processing features to Python.

Using SWIG, bindings for a large variety of programming languages can 
be created. The package currently supports Python, but it should not be 
too hard to generate bindings for other languages as well.

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Colors (RGBA)
+ Color space conversion (HSV, HSL, RGB)
+ Color bands to quickly generate ranges of colors
+ Image loading, PNG writing
+ Image pixel manipulation
+ Image processing (filters, compositing, normal map generation, …)
+ Blend modes
+ Gradients
+ Drawing (using cairo)
+ libnoise support

Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Altjira depends on the following packages:

+ Ionflux Object Base System (http://sf.net/projects/iftools)
+ Ionflux Template Processor (http://sf.net/projects/iftools)
+ IFMapping - Ionflux Mapping Library 
  (http://xi.ionflux.org/projects/stuff)
+ GDK-PixBuf (http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdk-pixbuf/, available 
  on most Linux distributions)

Make sure you get a recent SVN version of Ionflux Object Base System. 
Older packages will most likely not work.

You can checkout the recent source code from SVN like this:

svn co https://iftools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/trunk/ifobject ifobject-svn

svn co https://iftools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/trunk/iftemplate iftemplate-svn

Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build all of the dependencies before you try to build Altjira. There 
are build instructions included with the individual projects.

Note that all of the code is created using the Ionflux Template 
Processor.

However, the completed build of Altjira will not depend on Ionflux 
Template Processor.

Altjira uses SCons as the build system (http://www.scons.org/).

If you want to use custom configuration for the build process (for 
example, Python and library paths), copy 
site_scons/local_config.py.default to site_scons/local_config.py and 
adjust the settings as required.

If everything is set up correctly, you can build the project with 
'scons' in the main directory.

Using
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is intended for developers, so you should be able to derive 
how it is meant to be used from the source code documentation and the 
scripts in the 'test' directory. If you have any questions, you can 
still contact me by mail (mail@ionflux.org).

Enjoy!
