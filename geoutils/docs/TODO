Critical stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Mesh
  > OBJ import/export
  > binary import/export
  > make face normals consistent

+ Serialization
  > Face, FaceSet, FaceVector, NFace, VectorSet, VectorSetSet, FaceData

+ Vector buffer
  . same as the VertexAttribute buffer, but non-GL

+ Testing
  > NFace::getArea()
  > VertexAttribute
    . allocate(), resize(), append() [seems to work]
    . setDataComponents()

+ OpenGL utility library
  > render points
    . set point size
    . as small quad/tri surfaces
    . as boxes
  > viewer
    . better camera control which avoids singularities
  > shaders
    . specular reflection (Blinn-Phong)
    . texture (see FMViewer)
  > textures
    . copy GeoUtils::Image to texture (see FMViewer::ImageQuad, 
      Altjira::Drawable)
  > render to Image

+ VertexAttribute: make it a TransformableObject

+ add 'hasClassInfo = true' for parent classes that have class information.

+ Segfaults:
  > cg.Matrix3.create(r - cg.Matrix3.UNIT)

+ Use getValueString() instead of getString()

+ Make sure objects correctly implement copy assignment and the 
  IFObject::copy() function.
  > See if duplicate() can be replaced with copy(). If not, make the 
    difference clear in the docs.

+ Add create<numeric type>Vector<n>(..., <target vector>) functions.
  (necessary because swig does not recognize the vectors returned by such 
  functions as of the correct type)
  > create them automatically using a template

+ extractXMLVertices() adds a vertex to close the path by default, which 
  breaks getBarycenter() for low vertex counts.

+ Line3
  > intersectPlane(), intersectionInPoly()
    The line may lie within the plane. How is this handled?

+ Vector and Matrix types
  > the elements array should not be re-allocated in the copy function if 
    it is already defined

+ Vertex3::distanceToPlane()
  > The plane location should be subtracted from the vertex location for 
    calculating the distance. Make sure this works in all cases where the 
    function is used (Polygon3, Face).

+ Plane3
  > The binormal vector may not be orthogonal to tangent vector, although 
    the docs for getTangentBase() claim this.
    . test the fix
  > calculate the intersection line of two planes

+ Implement proper SVG path parsing in extractSVGVertices.
  > Handle cubic splines in a sensible way (discretize them).

+ BoundingBox
  > Synchronize the JavaScript implementation to the C++ implementation 
    (getItemsIn<primitive>(), getItemsIn<primitive>Inner() instead of surely 
    and maybe sets).
  > Extend getContainingLeaf() so that it returns a set of all leaves that 
    contain the target object.
                             
+ Make sure all pointers to managed objects are initialized to 0 before 
  set...() is called in a constructor.

+ Port test scripts to Python 3.

+ Enable create, upcast, classinfo on all classes.

+ Use create() instead of operator new.
  > otherwise check for 0 return values

+ Make sure all assignment operators support self-assignment.

+ In all cases where a reference is removed and then re-added, make sure it 
  is added before it is removed as the former might actually destroy the 
  object if that was the only reference.

+ Do some memory leak checking with valgrind.

+ Minimize copying of data across the library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Remove legacy XML I/O functions (Mesh, Face, Vertex3Set).

+ BoundingBox lookups use too much RAM.

+ Split GeoUtils into smaller libraries
  > basic vector math
  > transform nodes
  > other

+ BGeoUTils.Data.Mesh
  > vertex normals, smooth/flat shading should be exported correctly

+ Camera
  > still does not work in all cases (handedness, axis order)
    . getEulerAngles()
  > 'direction' should be the local camera system Z axis, not the direction 
    that the camera is looking
  > maybe just throw away and create a new implementation
  > adjustLocation mystery: the cause for this could have been the 
    erroneous 1 value at the (w, w) entry of the perspective matrix

+ Vertex3
  > Vertex3 should not duplicate so much functionality from Vector3. Maybe 
    make Vertex3 have a 'position' property that is a Vector3.

+ Testing
  > TransformableObject and derived classes
    . TransformableGroup, Object3, Polygon3, Polygon3Set, Shape3, 
      SVG, Image
    . seem to work well enough: Face, Mesh, Vertex3, Vertex3Set
  > Matrix
    . permuteRows, permuteColumns, multiply, transpose
    . XML I/O
    . seems to work well enough
  > Face
    . new face data API
    . seems to work well enough
  > Vector2, Vector3, Vector4
  > XML I/O (polymorphic)
    . Vector, VectorSet, VectorSetSet, Face, Vertex3, Vertex3Set, Mesh
    . seems to work well enough

+ BGeoUtils
  > Create a Blender version of cgeoutilstest31.
    . render CGeoUtils object in Blender
    . render Blender object in CGeoUtils
  > Visualization
    . Vertex3Set (as a collection of small spheres)
    . Edge (as a cylinder)
    . Mesh (as a collection of small spheres and cylinders)
  > export a scene (TransformableGroup containing Camera and Objects)
  > add an operator to export/import an object (Object3 XML I/O)
  > Blender Object.matrix_basis seems to require M^T as input but 
    provides M as output. Why is that the case?
  > test UV texture coordinate and vertex color transfer between Blender 
    mesh and GeoUtils mesh

+ Add a template for multiple splines and polygons in test/template.

+ MatrixMN
  > svd (use GSL)

+ Interpolate orientations using splines.

+ Viewer
  > use Ogre 3D
  > Python scripting

+ Transform nodes
  > Scale
    . Add a centering mode that scales only the distance to the origin 
      of individual objects in the group (i.e. objects are actually translated 
      along the location vector. none of the current modes achieves this).

+ TransformableObject
  > onTransformChanged(), onVIChanged() is apparently not used by any 
    other class. Maybe this feature can be dropped.

+ GeoUtils takes long to compile. Maybe break the core library into several 
  libraries.
  > math
  > transform nodes

+ Testing
  > BoundingBox
    . update(). Fixed some phoniness in the implementation across all 
      versions. The initial value of bounds should be the actual bounds of 
      the first element, not just its center or the range from the origin to 
      the center. Review this again.

+ BoundingBox
  > initFromSource(): The geoutils.py version does not seem to update the 
    bounds. While this is probably not necessary in most practical cases, it 
    still should be considered.
  > Use check<...>Inner() for intersection tests in the JavaScript and Python 
    versions instead of surely and maybe sets.

+ BGeoUtils
  > create a more readable grid
  > add operator for Mesh::makePlanar()
    . work on selected faces

+ Look for possible conflicts (especially regarding bounds calculation and 
  updating) in the classes derived from both BoxBoundsItem and 
  TransformableObject (Mesh, Face; update(), updateBounds(), getBounds(), 
  updateRadiusAndCenter()). 

+ Face
  > This is a TransformableObject but cannot be transformed without side 
    effects (vertices may belong to multiple faces). Therefore right now, it 
    is not possible to apply transformations to faces. Find a better solution 
    for this.
  > Validate the tangent and binormal vector calculations.
  > Add Face::clear() in all versions.
  > Move uv parameter to the back in Face constructor (Python version).

+ API changes
  > Polygon3::transform(Matrix3) is expected to translate the polygon to the 
    origin before the transformation is applied (required by 
    Line3::intersectionInPoly). This seems counterintuitive and should be fixed. 
    Polygons can now be translated using Polygon3::transform(Matrix4).
    [fixed in the c++ implementation]
  > BoxBoundsItem: Rename Vertex -> BoxVertex, Face -> BoxFace, to prevent 
    conflicts with derived classes that have their own vertices and faces 
    (like Face, Mesh etc.).
  > Polygon3, Polygon3Set: getBounds(), center()
  > Range3: setBounds(), extend() with other Range3.
  > Range: clamp(). Maybe add this to Range3 as well.
  > TransformableObject class hierarchy.

+ See which of the objects in the library are transformable and make them 
  transformable objects (Camera).

+ TransformableObject: Do some benchmarking on the transform matrix checks.

+ Generate the documentation using Doxygen.
  > Add a main page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice to have
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Mesh
  > Generator functions
    . torus() (see [stuff]/scripts/blender/BlenderObjects.py)

+ BGeoUTils.Data.Mesh
  > Loop indexing does not seem to match vertex indexing in all cases. Find 
    a robust method to obtain the loopOffset.
    . could be related to tri/quad face
    . could also be related to changes in the Blender API
    . seems to be solved for now

+ BGeoUtils
  > Mesh
    . support multiple UV/color face data layers

+ Transform nodes:
  > Each update call updates all outputs, not just the ones the caller was 
    interested in (also, clearInputGroups() removes all outputs, nut just 
    the ones the caller was interested in). Find a more efficient solution 
    for this.
  > Create the Distribute node.
  > Make sure each input node is updated only once per call to update().

+ Add Bezier curve based objects:
  > 3D splines [already supported by IFMapping]
  > Paths
  > Patches
  > Surfaces

+ Vector3Mapping:
  > Lookup3: Create static generator functions that create various types of 
    lookup tables for convenience.
  > Should be chainable with Mappings so the parameter can be 
    transformed before the Vector3 is generated.
  > Add Vector3Mappings that transform the output of one or more source 
    Vector3Mappings in some way (for example, MatrixTransform, Translate, 
    Rotate, Scale, LinearCombination etc.). This can then be used to replace 
    the oddly behaving limit ranges in Translate and Scale transform nodes.

+ Add some random shape manipulation/transformation functions for fun.
  > Scatter shapes (random, normal, fractal...).

+ Transform nodes:
  > Create transform node types:
    . Nodes that manipulate the number of groups:
    . Nodes that create groups:
      LoadMeshes: Load meshes from Blender or other input formats.
    . Nodes that manipulate the number of items in a group:
    . Nodes that transform items in a group:
      Interpolate: Interpolate polygons from the input group.
      ForceField: Translate objects by applying a force field originating 
        from a point or each of the elements. Parameters of the force field 
        could be controlled by ParamControl objects.
      Insert: Insert elements from an input group into member groups from 
        a second input group.
      Fractal: Apply a node to an input pattern. Apply the node again to the 
        resulting patterns. Repeat this a number of times.
      Place: Place elements from the first input group at the vertices of 
        polygons from the second input group.
      Distribute: Distribute elements from the input group along a path.
    . Nodes that create other representations of items:
      WriteMeshes: Write meshes to Blender or other output formats.

+ Transformable objects and groups:
  > Implement object transformations:
    . Distribute along path: Distribute object along a spline path (with 
      optional rotation according to tangent space).

+ Add more features that use Altjira.
  > Support for Altjira::Color (for example, in shape styles).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Side-tracks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Polygons
  > Allow simple lighting using a number of point light sources and select 
    a style according to the resulting intensity.

+ Brush creation
  > Make sure the correct style is used for sub-plygons inside a brush sheet 
    cell. This currently onls works if the number of styles divides the number 
    of sub-polygons evenly.
  > Transform brushes to an arbitrary 3D plane.
