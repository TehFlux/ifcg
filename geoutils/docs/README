What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

GeoUtils (Ionflux' Geometry Library) is a library that provides various 
classes and functions to support geometric computations and for managing 
geometric objects.

Implementations (in various states of completeness) are provided for 
C++, Python and JavaScript.

Using SWIG, bindings for a large variety of programming languages can 
be created for the C++ library. The package currently supports Python, 
but it should not be too hard to generate bindings for other languages 
as well.

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Basic vector math
+ Matrix transformations
+ Primitive 3D objects (Vertex, Line, Plane, Box, Sphere)
+ 3D Meshes
+ Tangent space (UV) calculations
+ Intersection checking
+ Axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tree data structure
+ Node-based modular transform and drawing
+ Procedural brush creation for GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/)
+ Integration with Blender (http://www.blender.org/) via Python
+ Drawing polygons and transformed images with SVG and PNG support
+ OpenGL viewer

Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

GeoUtils depends on the following packages:

+ Ionflux Object Base System (http://sf.net/projects/iftools)
+ Ionflux Template Processor (http://sf.net/projects/iftools)
+ IFMapping - Ionflux Mapping Library (http://sf.net/projects/ifcg)
+ Altjira - Ionflux' Image Processing Library (optional, required for 
  pixel based image output, http://sf.net/projects/ifcg)
+ Autodesk FBX SDK (optional, required for FBX file I/O, 
  http://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/overview)

Make sure you get a recent SVN version of Ionflux Object Base System. 
Older packages will most likely not work.

You can checkout the recent source code from SVN like this:

svn co https://iftools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/trunk/ifobject ifobject-svn

svn co https://iftools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/trunk/iftemplate iftemplate-svn

Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build all of the dependencies before you try to build GeoUtils. There 
are build instructions included with the individual projects.

Note that all of the code is created using the Ionflux Template 
Processor.

However, the completed build of GeoUtils will not depend on Ionflux 
Template Processor.

GeoUtils uses SCons as the build system (http://www.scons.org/).

If you want to use custom configuration for the build process (for 
example, Python and library paths), copy 
site_scons/local_config.py.default to site_scons/local_config.py and 
adjust the settings as required.

If everything is set up correctly, you can build the project with 
'scons' in the main directory.

Using
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is intended for developers, so you should be able to derive 
how it is meant to be used from the source code documentation and the 
scripts in the 'test' directory. If you have any questions, you can 
still contact me by mail (mail@ionflux.org).

Enjoy!
