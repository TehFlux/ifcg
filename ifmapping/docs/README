What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IFMapping (Ionflux Mapping Library) is a library written in C++ that 
provides types that can be used to construct functions, usually from |R 
to |R^n. It is designed to be used with Python.

Using SWIG, bindings for a large variety of programming languages can 
be created. The package currently supports Python, but it should not be 
too hard to generate bindings for other languages as well.

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Modular, chainable functions |R -> |R and |R -> |R³
+ Bezier curves and splines
+ Adaptive sampling of functions
+ Root finding
+ Floating point comparisons with tolerance

Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IFMapping depends on the following packages:

+ Ionflux Object Base System (http://sf.net/projects/iftools)
+ Ionflux Template Processor (http://sf.net/projects/iftools)

Make sure you get a recent SVN version of Ionflux Object Base System. 
Older packages will most likely not work.

You can checkout the recent source code from SVN like this:

svn co https://iftools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/trunk/ifobject ifobject-svn

svn co https://iftools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/trunk/iftemplate iftemplate-svn

Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build all of the dependencies before you try to build IFMapping. There 
are build instructions included with the individual projects.

Note that all of the code is created using the Ionflux Template 
Processor.

However, the completed build of IFMapping will not depend on Ionflux 
Template Processor.

IFMapping uses SCons as the build system (http://www.scons.org/).

If you want to use custom configuration for the build process (for 
example, Python and library paths), copy 
site_scons/local_config.py.default to site_scons/local_config.py and 
adjust the settings as required.

If everything is set up correctly, you can build the project with 
'scons' in the main directory.

Using
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is intended for developers, so you should be able to derive 
how it is meant to be used from the source code documentation and the 
scripts in the 'test' directory. If you have any questions, you can 
still contact me by mail (mail@ionflux.org).

Enjoy!
